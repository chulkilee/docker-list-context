# docker-list-context -- list files taken by Docker in a build context


`docker-list-context` lists files which are sent by the `docker build` command
to the Docker daemon as the *build context*.

You can reduce the build context (better performance, avoid leaking secrets) by ignoring
files in a `.dockerignore` file.
The official documentation for `.dockerignore` files is here: https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files

Tip: you can even ignore `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`, unless those files are referenced in the `Dockerfile`.

## Usage

List context files for `docker build .` (using `Dockerfile.dockerignore` or `.dockerignore`):

```console
$ docker-list-context
```

List context files for `docker build -f Prj1 .` (using `Prj1.dockerignore` or `.dockerignore`):

```console
$ docker-list-context -f Prj1 .
```

## Install

```console
$ go install github.com/dolmen-go/docker-list-context@latest
```
